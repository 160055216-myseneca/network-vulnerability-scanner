# Network Vulnerability Scanner

_Built to re-enforce knowledge of TCP/IP model, network scanning techniques, network vulnerabilities, and automation_

**network-vulnerability-scanner v.1** - Scans a network entirely using a combination of common network discovery/IP scanning tools (ping, netstat) and third-party Python libraries (socket, scapy) to output discovered hosts and open ports.


### **Built using Python:**

### **Networking Knowledge Used**

1. TCP/IP Model

_Utilized the TCP/IP model to map out and brainstorm the features and functionality the network scanner was going to have, and what steps to take towards implementing them._

The Internet and Transport layers of the TCP/IP model are the 2 main layers where IP operates and ensures packets are routed correctly, and where TCP/UDP operate to establish end-to-end port connections between devices. These 2 layers will allow us to access and use the components within their scopes to create a network scanning tool with various functionalities.

network-vulnerability-scanner (nvs) v.1 will use the Internet Protocol (IP) by addressing each host on a specified network and route ICMP Echo Request, TCP, and UDP packets to each address. Ultimately IP will give nvs the functionality to deliver scan requests to discover and communicate with the hosts on the network, recording which hosts are reachable.

Once a connection between nvs and host(s) are facilitated and established, nvs can shift its focus on to the Transport layer, where it will be able to establish connections with the discovered hosts and complete more comprehensive scanning. Further scanning can now take place to analyze each host for information, such as open ports and vulnerabilites. The TCP and UDP protocols will be used in this layer - nvs can determine which ports are open by utilizing scanning methods such as TCP connect, SYN, UDP, and port-specific scans.
